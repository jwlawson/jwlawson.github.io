# {{ page.title }}

I'm trying to see if Jekyll works. Or rather how it works - I'm sure it does work.

## Look a header

### And a smaller one.

Sometimes I don't really know what I'm doing.
I can't really remember how `markdown` works.

1. Make list
2. Do things

- Or
- Something
- Else


```c
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
   printf("Hello world");
}
```

I'm not even sure if that would compile...
