#{{ post.title }}

I'm trying to see if Jekyll works. Or rather how it works - I'm sure it does work.

##Look a header

###And a smaller one.

Sometimes I don't really know what I'm doing.
I can't really remember how `markdown` works.

[ ]Make list
[*]Do things

-Or
-Something
-Else

I forget how to do numbered lists.

```
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
   printf("Hello world");
}
```

I'm not even sure if that would compile...
