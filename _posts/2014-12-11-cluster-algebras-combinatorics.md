The conference on Cluster algebras in Combinatorics and Topology was held in
KIAS (the Korean Institute for Advanced Study), Seoul, Korea.

The day before the conference a small workshop on cluster algebras for young
mathematicians was held. I presented my work on minimal mutation-infinite
quivers at this workshop.

The main conference contained talks from many mathematicians studying cluster
algebras.
