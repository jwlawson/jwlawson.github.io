In December 2011 I made a small game for the 22nd Ludum Dare competition.

This was the first time I had made a whole game, from an empty project through 
to a complete product with menus, settings and most importantly gameplay. The 
whole experience was great fun and I got a number of incredible comments from 
other participants.

The game I chose to make was a top down maze/exploration game. Starting 
out in an abandonned space ship you find your way around before things 
start shooting at you. It was a fun introduction to the ideas behind 
programming games. I am sure there are many problems with the code and 
numerous things that I would do entirely different if I were to do it 
again.

Currently the game source is available on [Github](https://github.com/jwlawson/adrift).

### Post Mortem

The day after the competition I wrote the following post-mortem on the
experience:

##### The not so good: 

 * I was coding in Java using the LibGDX framework, which worked really well. 
Unfortunately there are parts of libGDX with little documentation, so I was 
frequently ducking into the source to try and work out how to get it to do what 
I wanted.

 * I had plans for a much more elaborate game with more graphics, more levels etc 
but as is the case with this, ran out of time. I think I spent too much time on 
the menus and other screens whereas the game should probably have come first.

 * Why can I never get up when my alarm goes off?

##### The better:

 * Sound effects were much easier to add than I had expected. Setting and 
remembering volume was a bit fiddly though, and making the sound I wanted in 
sfxr was time consuming although quite good fun.

 * I actually finished a game! Usually I get caught up in trying to optimise 
everything as I go along, but for this I was forced to just get on with making 
the game. This does of course mean performance is hit slightly. I was only 
getting about 20 to 30 FPS on my old laptop, but more modern machines should 
cope better.

 * I stole a second monitor from my sister after about 12 hours. Wow did it make 
everything easier. But now I have to give it back.

 * libGDX meant I could get a dekstop and applet version of my game made easily 
at the same time. I also have an Android version, but I have no idea how/if the 
controls work, what the performance is like, or what it looks like. I also have 
no way of testing it, so decided not to release the .apk file. (I did have it 
running in android-x86 in a virtual machine, but that was really slow).

Now to sort out my sleep patterns and retrain my fingers not to press Ctrl+s all 
the time.
