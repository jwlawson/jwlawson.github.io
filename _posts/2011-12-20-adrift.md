In December 2011 I made a small game for the 22nd Ludum Dare competition.

Ludum Dare is a game creation competition which runs every 4 months and 
challeges designers, programmers and artists to create a working game in just 48 
hours. See their [webpage](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/rules/) for more 
information.

This was the first time I had made a whole game, from an empty project through 
to a complete product with menus, settings and most importantly gameplay. The 
whole experience was great fun and I got a number of incredible comments from 
other participants.

The game I chose to make was a top down maze/exploration game. Starting 
out in an abandonned space ship you find your way around before things 
start shooting at you. It was a fun introduction to the ideas behind 
programming games. I am sure there are many problems with the code and 
numerous things that I would do entirely different if I were to do it 
again.

Currently the game source is not on Github, but I hope to get it up sometime.
