Following the shock decision by the UK to leave the EU, many ideas were put forward as to the reasons behind why so many people voted the ways that they did.

In an effort to learn more about data handling in python, using pandas, matplotlib and other fun stuff I scoured the internet for data and set about plotting graphs.

The election was different to all others that I am aware of in England. Every 
votes counted individually; at the end of the day the result was decided on 
precisely how many people had voted each way. None of the usual 
first-past-the-post, regional representation. As such the paper's and 
broadcaster's usual elections maps faced a problem. They had all been designed 
to colour each region by what party had won. In the referendum that didn't 
matter so much as the number of votes each way. 

Many places chose to separate the map into 4 colours: solid wins for each side 
and narrow wins for each side, with narrow usually meaning a 5% or 10% lead. So 
Newcastle with a
