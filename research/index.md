My main research interests lie in cluster aglebras. I have recently been 
studying automorphisms of cluster algebras and their links to the mapping
class groups of surfaces. This provides some techniques to finding
presentations of the mapping class group as well as certain subgroups.

These ideas could be extended to diagrams instead of just quivers, with the
automorphism group being a subgroup of the cluster automorphism of the cluster
algebra of the unfolded quiver.

Recently I finished a project to classify all minimal mutation-infinite
quivers. This work can be found in the [preprint] and more information 
can be found on the [project website].
