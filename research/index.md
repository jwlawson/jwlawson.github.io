My main research interests lie in cluster aglebras. I have recently been 
studying minimally mutation-infinite quivers and their relation to hyperbolic 
coxeter simplices. 

My work recently has involved writing code to compute all such quivers, a 
description of which can be found on the 
[quiver suite page]({{ site.baseurl }}/quiver).
