### Quiver computations 

Over the first half of 2014 I developed a suite of tools to compute the 
mutations of quivers. 

The aim of the project was to compute every minimally mutation-infinite quiver, 
that is each quiver which is mutation-infinite, but every subquiver is 
mutation-finite. 

### N-of-1 trial app 

In the summer of 2012 I developed a proof of concept android app to aid 
clinicians running N-of-1 trials. See the [main 
website](jwlawson.github.io/nof1) for more. 

The project has now ended and the software is no longer maintained, but the 
source is still available on [Github](github.com/jwlawson/nof1). 

### Ludum Dare 

I have participated in a number of the game creation competitions Ludum Dare. 

See the [Ludum Dare page]({{ site.baseurl }}/ludumdare) for more.
