### Quiver computations 

Over 2014 and 2015 I developed a suite of tools to compute the mutations of 
quivers. See the [quiver page][qv] for more.

The aim of the project was to compute every minimally mutation-infinite quiver, 
that is each quiver which is mutation-infinite, but every subquiver is 
mutation-finite. 

### N-of-1 trial app 

In the summer of 2012 I developed a proof of concept android app to aid 
clinicians running N-of-1 trials. See the [main website][nof1] for more. 

The project has now ended and the software is no longer maintained, but the 
source is still available on [Github][nof1 github]. 

### Ludum Dare 

I have participated in a number of the game creation competitions Ludum Dare. 

See the [Ludum Dare page][ludum dare] for more.
